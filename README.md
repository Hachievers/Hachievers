# **Analysis of Movie Lens Dataset**

The Group Research Project is a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Unoversity of Minnesota.
The dataset 'MovieLens' is widely used for collaborative filtering and other filtering solutions.

However, this dataset will be used to demonstrate our skill in Python to "play" with data.

The data was first downloaded as a Zip file from the data source, then the zip file was extracted into a folder named ml-100k.

# **Learning Outcomes:**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Visualization using Python
3. Pandas


Three files were imported/read from the folder into our jupyter notebook. 
These data were first cleaned, before exploring and visualizing for certain given task.
